This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a form context that provides A11y friednly validations and use.

### Tab validation
Validations occur AFTER user makes a change to a field. If a user leaves fields blank, then hits submit, all fields with valdiations will be validated.

Errors clear on blur or on clean submit.

### Page errors
Page errors are collected and shown at top in  separate component.

### Field errors
Field errors appear below the field.

## Todo
Rank page level errors. Right now errors aren't ranked. Need to add ranking.
